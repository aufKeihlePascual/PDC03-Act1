# M1 - Activity Lab 1

First Flutter activity for PDC03.

## Getting Started

Design a simple Flutter app based on the following specifications:
- A header bar with the title: "Introduction to Flutter."
- A body section displaying:
    - Your name and the text "PDC03 - Mobile Programming."
    - A button labeled "Show Message" that, when pressed, displays the message "Welcome to Mobile Application Development!" (Hint: Use StatefulWidget).
